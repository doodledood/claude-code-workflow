Review your branch changes, then stage all relevant files. Create a commit following the monorepo's Git conventions: use a type prefix (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, or revert) followed by a highly descriptive message that provides complete context. Your commit message should explain the rationale behind the changes, alternative approaches considered, any technical decisions made, and clear next steps. The message should be thorough enough that another developer could understand and continue your work without additional information or context. Format as 'type: detailed description' (e.g., 'fix: correct null property check in evaluation service to prevent runtime exceptions when processing incomplete user data'). Do not include attribution messages like 'Generated with Claude Code'. After committing, push your changes to the remote repository in a single workflow. You must also add "[agent]" at the end of the message for metric tracking.
